___
VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM VS DISTRIBUTED VCS
___
- VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
-- have files in single repository working developing on a new file
-- store all the version system
-- they would check out the version files
-- VCS benefits to store multiple version in a single repository

- DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

-- have the code shared across the team working on a software package
-- all the developer have entire code on their local system and keep updated all the time
-- The role of Distributed VCS server to ensure the developer or client has a updated version of the software
-- each person can share peer-to-peer
-- changes are being made to server are being redistributed to all development team
-- Remote Git Repository • people are making update of there codes to local environment
-- Local Environment • can be update manually and pushed out to the git repository
-- In repository you're able to pull back the latest update
and everyone in  a team can have an updated file

- GIT • is a distributed version control tool used for source code management
-- used to track changes in the source code
-- allow multiple developers to work together
-- supports non-linear development because of thousands of parallel branches
- GITHUB • remote server for that source code management
___
- GIT VS GITHUB
___
-- GIT
• software tool
• installed on a local system
• manage different versions of the source code
• provide command line to interact with files

-- GITHUB
• service
• hosted on the web
• have a copy of the local repository code
• graphical interface to store files
• you can pull projects from other
___
GIT ARCHITECTURE
___
Working Directory -> *git add* -> (LOCAL) Staging Area -> *git commit* -> Local Repository -> *git push* -> (REMOTE) Remote Repository "Github" -> *git pull* -> *git checkout*

••• After making all the changes, you commit those files to the local repository
••• You can push the committed files to the remote repository
••• Git pull fetches all the changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
___
GIT CONCEPT
___
- FORK AND CLONE
Fork - take the project and create a copy associated in a new team
Clone -- identical same structuring as the main project itself
download exact copy of that code with the same security and access rights as the main code
- ADDING COLLABORATORS
-- you can add people to work on your project
- BRANCH IN GIT
-- work on a new branch or features while some developers are on main branch or different branches and later can merge all files on the main branch
- PULL FROM A REMOTE
-- get a copy or pull request from a remote repository server
- GIT REBASE
-- take a project and re-established a new start from a project
-- working on a separate branch will not be able to branch their code back into the mainline branch
___
GIT FORKS AND CLONE
___
-- Fork mean make a separate copy of an original file to your local system
___ 
GIT COLLABORATORS
___
-- is ability to have team members working on a project together
-- Type of permissions
• Access all the files
• View the files
• Make changes to files
• Commit the files
___
BRANCHING ON GIT
___
e.g.
                                                   ↑ - - - - (New Branch) - - - - 
Application (Master Branch) - - - - - - -
••• By default you always work on the master branch


                                               ↑- - - - (New Branch) - - - - - -  ↓
Application (Master Branch) - - - - - - - connected - - - - - -
___
GIT MERGE
___
            (d) - - - (e) - - - (f) - - - - -*feature* - - -
             ↑                                                     ↓
(a) - - - (b) - - - (c) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (g) *master*
             ↑• base commit of feature branch

••• there can be multiple divergent branches
___
GIT REBASE
___
••• sequence on combining a commits to a new base commits

(a) - - - (b) - - - (c) - - - - - - - (d) - - - *feature* - - - (e) - - *feature* - - (f)
                          ↑• "c" current base commit feature
                              (tip of master)

••• b was changed into c as base commit
••• rebase advantage is you reducing the amount storage spaces required and reduce total footprint

••• the primary reason for rebasing is "to maintain a linear project history"
••• when you rebase, you "unplug" a branch and "replug" it on the tip of a master branch and make a new master branch
••• the goal of rebasing is to take all the commits from a feature branch and put it on a master branch
___
PULL FROM REMOTE
___
••• they make changes to their codes and submit it to the remote repository
••• both of them want to stay updated with the recent changes to their repository
••• they can pull the changes from the remote repository on to their local system
___
