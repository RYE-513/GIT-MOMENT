A Version Control System "VCS" that changes made to our code over time in a special database called "repository"

repository is centralized with the back end of "Project History" to see who has made what changes when and why.
and if we screw or made a problem/malfunction on its program we can easily revert to an earlier state

VCS
- Track History
- Work together

2 Categories of VCS
- Centralized  •  all team members or department connected with one database and share their changes with others. "Subversion" and "Microsoft Team"
Disadvantage: if the server is offline we  cannot save snapshot and we have to wait until the server comes back online.
- Distribured  • 


USING GIT 

 • The command line
 • Code Editors & IDES
